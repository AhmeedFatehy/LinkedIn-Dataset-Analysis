# LinkedIn-Dataset-Analysis
The purpose of this research is to provide useful information for jobs recommendation system on LinkedIn using graph analysis. By providing a data-set, a graph was constructed and analyzed using igraph and networkx libraries in Python. The degree distribution analysis is used to indicate the presence of companies within some parts of the graph. The connected components analysis also does indicate the relationships between the subgraphs and find the separated nodes that may be added to the larger components by recommendation. And there is also an important analysis which is community discovery that is the most significant analysis as it discovers the communities within the graph and that can be used to understand the replacements that may be done and recommend it to the employees within the community. And there are more analysis that will be discussed in the research later.
